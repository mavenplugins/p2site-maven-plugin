 !!! In addition the compare URL links are to be maintained at the end of this CHANGELOG.md as follows.
     These links provide direct access to the GitHub compare vs. the previous release.

     At the end of this file appropriate compare links have to be maintained for each release version in format:
 
  +-current release version
  |
  |                   +-URL to this repo             previous release version tag-+       +-current release version tag
